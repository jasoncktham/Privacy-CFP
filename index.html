									<h2>The case of wearables</h2>
									<p>Earlier this year, Oral Roberts University (ORU) of Tulsa, Oklahoma garnered media attention from all over the world for their new institution-wide fitness program that <a href="http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20160104_fitbit_tracking.php">requires incoming freshmen to wear Fitbit trackers</a> to record 10,000 steps per day, with the information being made available to professors. With GPS technology and movement sensors, the Fitbit devices are able to track how and where students exercise, eat, and sleep; how much calories they burn; what they weigh; and other personal health-related information. Throughout a typical week, students are required to meet the daily steps goal and the heartbeat-per-minute standard. As we would expect, there has been mixed reviews on this kind of integration––some say it is outright unlawful to reveal student personal health information to professors, others think the integration of wearable technology in student campus life is a smart way to promote health awareness and reduce human labor in entering student aerobics points for the required fitness program.</p>

									<h2>Responding to the call</h2>
									<p>The ORU instance corresponds directly to two of the four interest areas stated in the CFP of this collection:
										<ul>
											<li>Ways surveillance impact culture(s) and influence daily habits and/or lives as it connects to digital rhetoric and writing, e.g., algorithmic discrimination, fitness trackers, Internet of Things objects, social media habits, intellectual property.</li>
											<li>How digital rhetoric and writing scholars/educators inform public and private industries to make reforms to surveillance practices.</li>
										</ul>
											<p>Institutions today are not afraid to make bold changes, but faculty experts are seldom consulted in the process. As in the ORU case, we observe no faculty involvement in such decision making, especially those whose research could inform this kind of radical implementation. Yet, as rhetoricians and writing studies scholars, we are well positioned to critique and provide grounded recommendations for reforming digital practices as they pertain to student learning experience and beyond.</p>

									<h2>Question to begin</h2>
									<p>In this proposed chapter, we ask: <b>In an age of pervasive technology––where the lines between public, private, and hybrid information are increasingly blurred––how might digital rhetoric inform our administrative and pedagogical practices involving student data in and outside the classroom?</b></p>
									<p>Acknowledging the proliferation of wearable technologies, we seek to address the rhetorics of pervasiveness, control, and digital discrimination. Particularly, we challenge the popular assumptions of surveillance and privacy by scrutinizing what it means to watch and be watched, what counts as personal and what counts as public in the face of pervasive or ubiquitous computing, who owns “big” data, and how might we go about teaching digital literacy with and for emerging technologies (Duin et al., 2016). Our discussion will be informed by the works of Laura Gurak (1997, 2001), Estee Beck (2015), Gail Hawisher and Cynthia Selfe (1991), John Logie (2006), Jessica Reyman (2013), Henry Jenkins (2006), Roy Baumeister and John Tierney (2012), and Jim Purdy (2009), to list a few.</p>
									<p>In our webtext, we plan to embed rich media illustrating our point-in-discussion, including links to cases we reference, videos that introduce certain wearable devices, and galleries that showcase our past and present classroom deployments of wearable technologies as a way of reframing the discussions in our chapter. </p>
